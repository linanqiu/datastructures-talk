Data structures?

---

## Calibration (1)


- Big-O and complexity?
- Interfaces vs. Implementation

---

## Calibration (2)

- Arrays?
- Linked Lists?
- Stacks and Queues?
- Hashing? Maps?

---

## Calibration (3)

- Garbage collection?
- Immutability? Immutable data structures?
- Persistent data structures?

---

## Preface

- Language agnostic, so I used `python`
- Trigger warning for folks with Mathematics / CS Theory background (why are you here anyway?)

---

## Data Structures

- Data lives in memory
- How we store that data in memory is important
- Computers are fast...but not that fast

---

## Big-O

$$f(x) = O(g(x))$$

if and only if

$$|f(x)| \leq M|g(x)|$$

for all $$x \geq x_0$$

## Complexity

- $$O(1)$$

```python
x = 5
```

- $$O(n)$$

```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in x:
    print(i * 2)
```

---

- $$O(n^2)$$

```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in x:
    for j in x:
        print(i + j)
```

- $$O(\log{n})$$: binary search
- $$O(n\log{n})$$: most (practical) sorting algorithms
