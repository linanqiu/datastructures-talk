Data structures?

---

## Calibration (1)


- Big-O and complexity?
- Interfaces vs. Implementation

---

## Calibration (2)

- Arrays?
- Linked Lists?
- Stacks and Queues?
- Hashing? Maps?

---

## Calibration (3)

- Garbage collection?
- Immutability? Immutable data structures?
- Persistent data structures?

---

## Preface

- Language agnostic, so I used `python`
- Trigger warning for folks with Mathematics / CS Theory background (why are you here anyway?)

---

## Data Structures

- Data lives in memory
- How we store that data in memory is important
- Computers are fast...but not that fast

---

## Big-O

$f(x) = O(g(x))$

if and only if

$\abs{f(x)} \leq M\abs{g(x)}$

for all $x \geq x_0$
